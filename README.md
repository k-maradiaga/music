# Corpus
The corpus that is used in my analysis consists out of all the national anthems of the world. The aim of this corpus is to analyze what musical characteristics of a song make it a national anthem. I find it interesting to see how one song can become so nationally known and rooted in a country. Within the corpus the music therefore all share the common factor that it is the national anthem of a country. One interesting aspect to consider is the geographical and cultural influences of national anthems to see if countries that are close together also share similarites of the same style in their national anthems. Another point of comparison could be the year that the national anthem song has been composed to see if it has any impact on the style of the national anthem compared to other countries that were composed in the same time period. 

Typical national anthems are hard to define but one national anthem that stands out from the rest is the one from Nepal which anthem was introduced relatively recently and therefore uses more modern instruments distinguishing it from most older anthems.

It is important to note that the corpus is representative of all the national anthems of today, however, many national anthems have changed over time since their original composition. This can be seen as a limitation of the analysis, as it does not account for the historical evolution of national anthems. Nevertheless, this corpus offers a wealth of information about the musical characteristics of national anthems and is still able to provide a strong representation of the cultural heritage of a country.
